# FPGA-Based Ramp Signal Generator with Python GUI

This project was developed during my internship at the **Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), Gandhinagar**, to create a real-time **ramp signal generator** using a **Spartan-6 FPGA** and **DAC5684**. A custom-built Python GUI allows the user to control the **frequency** and **amplitude** of the generated signal in real time.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Verilog HDL** – for FPGA design
- **Xilinx Spartan-6** – target FPGA
- **TI DAC5684** – digital-to-analog converter
- **Python (Tkinter)** – GUI for control
- **UART Protocol** – communication interface

---

## 💡 Project Highlights

- 🔁 **Ramp waveform generation** on FPGA
- 🎚️ **User-defined frequency & amplitude** via GUI
- 🔌 **UART communication** between Python and FPGA
- 📈 Output verified on oscilloscope in lab environment

## 🧠 My Contributions

- Designed Verilog logic for **ramp waveform timing and amplitude scaling**
- Developed a **Python GUI** to send control commands (frequency/amplitude) to FPGA
- Implemented a **UART receiver** module for real-time updates
- Performed **hardware testing** and signal validation using DAC and oscilloscope
